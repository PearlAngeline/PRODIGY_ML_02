# PRODIGY_ML_02 — Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Task Objective
This project is part of my **PRODIGY Machine Learning Internship (Task 02)**.  
The objective is to group customers of a retail store into meaningful segments based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using **K-Means Clustering** (unsupervised learning).

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Dataset: [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  
- Loaded using pandas  

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values  
- Selected relevant features: `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`  
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`  

### 3️⃣ Model Building
- Applied **K-Means Clustering**  
- Determined optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method**  
- Assigned cluster labels to each customer  

### 4️⃣ Visualization
- Plotted customer segments on 2D scatter plot  
- Visualized cluster distribution and customer patterns
